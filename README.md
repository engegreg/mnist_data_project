# mnist_data_project
The end goal of this project is to make a neural network that predicts live input. Currently in early development.


As of right now, I've developed the base model which can accurately predict numbers from the mnist dataset. The following updates will be produced:

Adding additional data for the machine to train

Creating a UI that allows users to draw numbers - this will both store the new numbers and output a prediction
